A simple API for a coffee loyalty program.

Included is a json file downloaded from postman where I made tests for endpoint.
But that the endpoints work can be seen from the front end, although you need to refresh the search to see the updated stamps and coffees after those buttons are pressed.

Run yarn to install dependencies.

See package.json for scripts.
